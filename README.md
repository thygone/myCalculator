# myCalculator
## Overview

The purpose of this app was for me to try making a basic calculator that can be used on a phone. I have had little to no expierience with Android Studio, and had wanted to expand my capabilities.

This app is, like I mentioned, a simple calculator. It works by taking the two numbers that you enter into the text boxes. Then, based on which button you push, it will add, multiply, subtract, or divide your two numbers, showing the result in the last box.

## Development Environment


I used the android studio app, using the kotlin language.
I imported the widget.button and widget.editText, random, textview, and view libraries.

## Future Work
* add in a keypad for the number input
* add in additionaly operations that can be performed (such as the sin, cos, and tan operators)
* provide a way to save the results of the equations for future use.
* clear button
